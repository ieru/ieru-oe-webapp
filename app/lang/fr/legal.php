    <p>
        Organic.Lingua Platform has been designed by the partners of the Consortium of the Research Project
        <em>
           Demonstrating the potential of multilingual Web Portal for Sustainable Agricultural & Environmental Education.
        </em>
        (Organic.Lingua), specially by a group of researches from the University of Alcal·.
    </p>
    <p>
        The research project Organic.Lingua is an European project funded under the Seventh Framework Information Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme of the
        European Union [Theme [CIP-ICTPSP.2010.6.2] Multilingual Online Services. Grant agreement 270999].
    </p>
    <p>
        The Consortium is composed of eleven members from different European states. These members include the University of Alcal· as controller for the design
        and operation of this Platform.
    </p>
    <p>
        Organic.Lingua Platform is a social platform that integrates open access institutional repositories in the field of organic agriculture, and employs the
    AGROVOC thesaurus in combination with other more specific search methods. It is hosted on the site    <a href="http://organic-edunet.eu/">http://organic-edunet.eu</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong><em>2.2. Target</em></strong>
        <em></em>
    </p>
    <p>
        Organic.Lingua is aiming to enhance an existing Web portal (http://www.organic-edunet.eu) with educational content on Organic Agriculture (OA) and Agroecology (AE), introducing automated multi-lingual services that will further support the uptake of the portal from its targeted audiences, facilitate the multilingual features of the portal, and further extend its geographical and linguistic coverage.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Organic.Edunet Web portal bridges together a network of learning repositories with content on OA & AE, providing its users with a significant volume of relevant learning resources. It adopts a federated, standards-based approach that allows the incremental growth of the network.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Organic.Lingua project aims to capitalise on the European and international demand for the Organic.Edunet portal by transforming it into a truly multilingual service. It will achieve this by re-engineering the architecture and enhancing the services of the existing Organic.Edunet portal, in order to fill the abovementioned gaps in multilingual support and cross-language resource organization and search.
    </p>
    <p>
        It particularly aims at analyzing and re-engineering the service infrastructure and related facilities and business models in order to support multilingual access and use more widely and effectively. Since such linguistic limitations of Organic.Edunet are common to most current multilingual Web portals, an important outcome of the Organic.Lingua project is expected to be a set of guidelines, good practice methods and software tools that can be adopted in other portal cases.
    </p>
    <p>
        Overall, Organic.Lingua aims to make the Organic.Edunet Web portal a service that will support agricultural researchers and educators around Europe, as well as explore new business opportunities for the specific service but also for the developers/providers of language technologies.
